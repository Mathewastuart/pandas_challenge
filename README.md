Overview
----------------

The Data analysis takes the scores of math and reading across different schools, being either District or Charter Schools
Budget is also provided.

The data is presented in numerous ways to help draw conclusions
1. District SUmmary
2. School Summary
3. Math/Reading Scores by grade
4. Scores by school spending
5. Scores by school size
6. Scores by School type

Distict Summary Conclusions
--------------------------------
The district summary across 15 schools shows that more students are passing reading than math. 
Seeing as this is an overall summary there aren't many conclusions we can draw from this alone.

School Summary
-----------------------
In the school summary we break down the individual data for each school
By showing the top perfroming schools we see that all 5 are charter schools and have lower overall school budgets than the bottom perfroming schools
However, the per student budget is simmilar in both the bottom and top performing schools
In order to get more valueable conclusions we should look into how that money is spent on each student, and determine how that afffects the outcome
This could also determine why charter schools perform higher than district schools
A higher sample of charter schools would also provide more meaningful data

Math/Reading Scores by Grade
----------------------------
In Order to extract meaningful information from these we get an average score across all four grades in a school. Looking at the data, we see no big difference in perfromance across grades with most of the averages being between 80-85.
This shows no trends that would indicate grade level affects performance

Scores By School Spending
------------------------------
The lower the budget the higher the scores seem to be, but as mentioned earlier, this could be from the fact that some of these are charter schools and we should look into how the money is spent on each individual student rather than the amount.
A higher sample of charter schools would be beneficial here as well

Scores by School Size
--------------------------
Shows that smaller schools produce higher average scores. Looking back we see that the charter schools have the smaller populations as well
Perhaps the fact that charter schools have less students can be a reason as to why they are getting higher grades despite having a smaller budget

Scores By school type
--------------------------
Once again demonstrates that charter schools outperfrom the dsitrict schools, especially in math.
There is only about a 3 point difference in average reading scores, but math has about a 7 point difference in average score.
Finding the standard deviaiton across the scores could help us determine if the difference in these scores is statistically significant, especially considering charter schools have a lower popualtion of studetns and are represented less in the data set.
